=================

http://malware.wicar.org HTML content, which includes test browser exploits. See http://wicar.org/ for details.

Please note that this is NOT a github.io page, as the malware URL is manually updated by a human (with content from this repository). Therefore, changes may be accepted but won't be live immediately if you wish to add new browser exploits etc, which need to be vetted.
